  <h3 align="center">A new logo for EasyBuild <em>(2022-11-14)</em></h3>
  </header>
  <section>
  <p>
  On 13 November 2022, it was exactly <strong>10 years</strong> ago that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/easybuild/1.0.0">EasyBuild v1.0</a> was released.
  </p>
  <p>
  This called for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crXchK5SRys">celebration</a>. Or perhaps, something more than that...<br/>
  Maybe it was time for something new, to refresh a particular aspect of EasyBuild that was due refreshing.<br/>
  What if we could <em>evolve</em> a part of EasyBuild that could be significantly improved, and make the project
  look a bit more professional?<br/>
  How about... <strong>a new logo</strong>?
  </p>
  <h3>The original logo</h3>
  <p>In the process of publicly releasing EasyBuild in 2012, we came up with a logo ourselves.
  After a lot of discussion (and a couple of strong Belgian beers), we ended up with a logo "design" on a
  whiteboard. One of our team members took a picture of it, and traced it to obtain a vectorized version of it.
  There, was had a logo:</p>
  <div align="center">
      <img src="https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/raw/develop/logo/old_logo_2012-2022/easybuild_logo_alpha.png" width="250px"/>
  </div>
  <p>
  Not bad for a couple of semi-drunk Belgians, right?
  </p>
  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>
  We didn't just want any new EasyBuild logo: we wanted a <em>fitting</em> one, one that was easy to recognize.<br/>
  And if this time it didn't look like it was drawn by a 5-year old, that was a plus, of course...
  </p>
  <p>
  So, we defined a couple of requirements for the new logo:
  <ul>
    <li>There should be a clear connection to the original logo;</li>
    <li>It should be distuinguishable, and work well on both light and dark backgrounds (like any good logo);</li>
    <li>Ideally, it features multiple aspects that clearly tie it to topics relevant to EasyBuild, like software installation,
        performance, community, the 3-level design of the project (framework, easyblocks, easyconfigs), ...</li>
  </ul>
  We quickly realised this was a daunting task for anyone who has little to no experience in graphics design,
  which (clearly...) includes us, so this time we hired some professional help.
  </p>

  <h3>The result</h3>
  <p>
  A couple of weeks ago, an initial design of a new logo was presented to us.
  It was not a an immediate success, which did not surprise us since it was difficult to disconnect ourselves
  from the original logo after using it for over a decade.<br/>
  After iterating over the initial design a bit by tweaking various aspects of it, and collecting feedback from
  a couple of individuals, we ended up with a new EasyBuild logo that had our full support.
  </p>
  <div align="center">
      <img src="./images/easybuild_logo_2022_vertical_light_bg_transparent_trimmed_border.png" width="300px"/>
  </div>
  <p>
  The new logo clearly meets the requirements we defined:
  <ul>
      <li>It works well on both light and dark backgrounds, with minimal differences between the corresponding variants;</li>
      <li>Both the <em>URL</em> to the EasyBuild website and our infamous <em>slogan</em> are integrated in it,
          yet are easy to remove if deemed necessary without really harming the logo;</li>
      <li>It features multiple "<em>blocks</em>", which connects with both the original logo and the concept of
          <em>easyblocks</em> in EasyBuild;
      <li>The <em>colors</em> of the blocks in the original logo are retained, in the same order, though in a softer pastel
          variant, which results in a more modern look;</li>
      <li>3 rows of blocks are <em>stacked</em> on top of each other (and on top of 'EasyBuild', and our slogan),
          which matches both with the 3-level design of EasyBuild, and with the fact it is used to install <em>software
          stacks</em>;</li>
      <li>The rows of blocks collectively form a capital 'E', which is a nice touch;</li>
      <li>The color palette is inspired by <em>syntax highlighting</em> in a code editor, which compliments nicely with the
          camel-case spelling of 'EasyBuild' since that is the usual convention for class names in Python code
          (and it complies better with how we usually "spell" the project name than the original logo does);</li>
  </ul>
  Next to these intentional design aspects, a couple of additional characteristics can be recognized, with a bit of
  imagination:
  <ul>
      <li>The rows of blocks can hint towards collaboration, which fits well with both the <em>community</em>
          aspect of the EasyBuild project, as well as corresponding to the fact that the EasyBuild framework (bottom row)
          consists of <em>multiple subpackages</em> that collectively provide required functionality, the easyblocks (middle row)
          that <em>inherit</em> from another to define the installation process, and the <em>set</em> of easyconfigs (top row)
          that are used to install a software application and all its required dependencies;</li>
      <li>In addition, the rows of blocks can also be interpreted as <em><a href="https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Progress_bars.html">progress bars</a></em>
          that show how far an installation has progressed, and be a hint towards the <em>performance</em> of software that is central
          to the EasyBuild project;</li>
      <li>In total, there are exactly <em>10 blocks</em> in the logo, one for each year that EasyBuild has been publicly
          available so far. Coincidence? Maybe...</li>
  </ul>
  Everything combined, this new logo is a great fit for EasyBuild, and it respects both the key aspects and the history
  of the project.<br/>
  The initial feedback has been very positive, and we are extremely happy with how this whole ordeal worked out.<br/>
