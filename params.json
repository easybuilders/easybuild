Furthermore, a working C and C++ compiler must be installed on the system.\r\n\r\nThe [GitPython](http://gitorious.org/git-python) Python module is recommended, especially when EasyBuild is being used from a git repository.\r\n\r\nSee [dependencies](https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Dependencies)for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUICK DEMO FOR THE IMPATIENT\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nTo see EasyBuild in action, build HPL with the robot feature of EasyBuild, by\r\nrunning the following (bash/sh syntax):\r\n\r\n    export EBHOME=\"<path to where you unpacked EasyBuild>\"\r\n    ${EBHOME}/easybuild.sh --robot ${EBHOME}/easybuild/easyconfigs \\\r\n        ${EBHOME}/easybuild/easyconfigs/h/HPL/HPL-2.0-goalf-1.1.0.eb\r\n\r\nThis will build and install HPL, after building and installing a GCC-based\r\ncompiler toolkit and all of its dependencies using the default EasyBuild\r\nconfiguration, which will install to $HOME/easybuild/software.\r\n\r\nThe entire process should take about an hour on a recent system.\r\n\r\nModule files will be provided in $HOME/easybuild/modules/all, so to load the\r\nprovided modules, update your MODULEPATH environment variable.\r\n\r\nNote: this demo requires a C and C++ compiler to be available on your system,\r\ne.g., gcc and g++.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUICK START\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTo get started, you first need to configure EasyBuild for use [as explained here.](https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Configuration).\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, using EasyBuild is as simple as creating a .eb specification\r\nfile, and providing it to the framework:\r\n\r\n\teasybuild/easybuild.sh example.eb\r\n\r\nFor command line options, see \r\n\r\n\teasybuild/easybuild.sh -h (or --help)\r\n\r\nDocumentation on writing your own .eb specification files is available on the\r\n[EasyBuild github wiki](https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Specification-files).\r\n\r\nTo add support for a particular software package that requires a custom\r\ninstallation procedure, you will need to[ implement an easyblock](https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Development-guide) that can be plugged into the EasyBuild framework.\r\n\r\nA step-by-step guide to getting started with EasyBuild is provided on \r\nthe [github wiki](https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Step-by-step-guide).\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nEasyBuild has mainly been tested on RPM-based 64-bit Linux systems, i.e.,\r\nScientific Linux 5.x/6.x.  Support for other Linux distributions and operating\r\nsystems is pending.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n--------\r\n\r\nEasyBuild is made available under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.\r\n\r\n"}
