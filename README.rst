`EasyBuild <https://easybuild.io>`_ is a software build
and installation framework that allows you to manage (scientific) software
on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient way.

Sources
~~~~~~~

The EasyBuild sources are spread across different GitHub repositories:

* the `main easybuild repository <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild>`_ hosts the documentation and the `easybuild` Python metapackage
* the `easybuild-framework repository <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework>`_ hosts the source code of the EasyBuild `framework`
* the `easybuild-easyblocks repository <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks>`_ hosts `easyblocks`, i.e. implementations of install procedures
* the `easybuild-easyconfigs repository <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs>`_ hosts `easyconfigs`, i.e. EasyBuild specification files
* the _`easybuild-docs repository <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-docs>`_ contains the *sources* of the EasyBuild documentation, which is hosted at https://docs.easybuild.io.

Corresponding Python packages are available via PyPi:

* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/easybuild
* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/easybuild-framework
* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/easybuild-easyblocks
* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/easybuild-easyconfigs

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the fine manual (RTFM!) at http://docs.easybuild.io .

Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended way of installing EasyBuild is `using pip <https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Installation.html>`_.
You should `configure <http://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Configuration.html>`_
EasyBuild to behave as you prefer, subsequently.

That is all that is needed to get started with installing (scientific) software with ease.
Take a look at the `typical workflow <http://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Typical_workflow_example_with_WRF.html>`_
example in the EasyBuild documentation that shows how to make EasyBuild build and **install WRF with a single command**.

Quick demo for the impatient
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After `installing EasyBuild <http://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Installation.html>`_,
you can build and install **HPL** on top of a compiler toolchain that consists of open source
components (GCC, OpenMPI, etc.) by running the following commands::

  $ module load EasyBuild
  $ export EASYBUILD_PREFIX=/tmp/$USER  # example installation prefix
  $ eb HPL-2.3-foss-2019b.eb --robot

This should install a module file for HPL which you can load to start using it::

  $ export MODULEPATH=$EASYBUILD_PREFIX/modules/all:$MODULEPATH
  $ module load HPL

For more information on using EasyBuild, see the
`EasyBuild documentation <http://docs.easybuild.io/>`_
