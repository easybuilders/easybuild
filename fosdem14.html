        <p>
        <em><a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a></em> is a free and open source software developers meeting which is organized annually in Brussels (Belgium),
        and is attended by over 5000 open source enthusiasts from all over the world.<p/>
        <p>FOSDEM'14 will host a <em><em>developer room</em> (devroom)</em> on <em><em>High-Performance Computing (HPC) and computational science</em></em>,
        providing an opportunity for open source software developers in the HPC community to present their work and discuss it with FOSDEM attendees.</p>

        <p>The devroom organization is taken care of by the <a href="http://www.ugent.be/hpc/en">HPC team of Ghent University</a> (<em><a href="twitter.com/HPCUGent">@HPCUGent</a></em>), in collaboration with
        the <a href="https://vscentrum.be/nl/en">Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC)</a>.</p>
        <p>FOSDEM'14 takes place in the weekend of <em>February 1st - 2nd 2014</em> at the ULB campus Solbosch in <em>Brussels (Belgium)</em>.

<h2><a>Call for Participation</a></h2>

<p>We invite <em>system administrators, user support team members and end users</em> of HPC infrastructure to present their
<em>open source software project(s)</em> during this friendly and open-minded meeting.<br/>
Topics should include tools relevant to the HPC community, scientific software projects, ..., that adhere to the 'open source' format is some way or another.</p>

<p>Submissions should focus on the <em>functionality, features, design and other interesting broad aspects</em> of an open source software project, and
<em>should not include too much technical content</em> that is (research) domain-specific or assumes deep knowledge of the topic.</br>
We aim to host talks with a sufficient amount of interesting content to attendees with widely different backgrounds, which does <em>not</em> exclude submissions
on software projects that focus on particular scientific research domains.</p>

<p>We also welcome <em>other activity proposals</em> different from 'traditional' project presentations: <em>discussions</em> on a particular topic, <em>hacking sessions</em>, etc.<br/>
Please contact the devroom organizers directly if you have any suggestions for activities like this in HPC devroom.</p>

(via "Create event").</p>

<p><em>Make sure you select the "HPC and computational science" devroom track when making your submission(s)!</em></p>

<p>Submissions should include:
<ul>
<li>an <em>abstract</em> of max. 250 words briefly describing the subject of the talk</li>
<li>a rough <em>outline</em> of the talk (informal, a short list of bullet points mentioning topics that will be discussed)</li>
<li><em>intended audience</em> and <em>goal</em> of the talk (for example, "bioinformaticians, let them discover my fantastic project" or "HPC sysadmins,
feedback and open discussion on my tool")</li>
<li>contact information (email)</li>
</ul></p>
