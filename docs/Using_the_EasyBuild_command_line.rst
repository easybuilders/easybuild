Using the EasyBuild command line
================================

Basic usage of EasyBuild is described in the following sections, covering the most important range of topics if you are new to EasyBuild.
 
``eb`` is EasyBuildâ€™s main command line tool, to interact with the EasyBuild framework
and hereby the most common command line options are being documented.

Specifying builds
-----------------

By providing a single easyconfig file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The most basic usage is to simply provide the name of an easyconfig file to the ``eb`` command.
EasyBuild will (try and) locate the easyconfig file, and perform the installation as specified by that easyconfig file.
 
For example, to build and install ``HPL`` using the ``goolf`` toolchain::
 
  $ eb HPL-2.0-goolf-1.4.10.eb --robot
  [...]
  == building and installing GCC/4.7.2...
  [...]
  == building and installing goolf/1.4.10...
  [...]
  == building and installing HPL/2.0-goolf-1.4.10...
  == fetching files...
  == creating build dir, resetting environment...
  == unpacking...
  == patching...
  == preparing...
  == configuring...
  == building...
  == testing...
  == installing...
  == taking care of extensions...
  == packaging...
  == postprocessing...
  == sanity checking...
  == cleaning up...
  == creating module...
  == COMPLETED: Installation ended successfully
  == Results of the build can be found in the log file /home/example/.local/easybuild/software/HPL/2.0-goolf-1.4.10/easybuild/easybuild-HPL-2.0-20141031.223237.log
  == Build succeeded for 9 out of 9
  == temporary log file /tmp/easybuild-UOEWix/easybuild-NiswcV.log has been removed.
  == temporary directory /tmp/easybuild-UOEWix has been removed.

Then, we can actually load the freshly installed HPL module::

  $ module load HPL/2.0-goolf-1.4.10
  $ which xhpl
  /home/example/.local/easybuild/software/HPL/2.0-goolf-1.4.10/bin/xhpl
 
All easyconfig file names' suffixes are ``.eb`` and follow format::

   ``<name>-<version>-<toolchain>-<versionsuffix>``

This is a crucial design aspect, since the dependency resolution mechanism (see :ref:`use_robot`) relies upon this convention.
 
.. tip:: You may wish to modify the installation prefix (e.g., using ``--prefix`` or by defining ``$EASYBUILD_PREFIX``),
  in order to redefine the build/install/source path prefix to be used; default value is: ``$HOME/.local/easybuild``.

Via command line options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
An alternative approach is to only use command line options to specify which software to build.
Refer to the ``Software search and build options`` section in the ``eb --help`` output for an overview
of the available command line options for this purpose (cfr. :ref:`basic_usage_help`).
 
Here is how to build and install last version of HPCG (that EasyBuild is aware of)
using the ``goolf/1.4.10`` toolchain::
 
  $ eb --software-name=HPCG --toolchain=goolf,1.4.10
  [...]
  == building and installing HPCG/2.1-goolf-1.4.10...
  [...]
  == COMPLETED: Installation ended successfully
  [...]

At this point, a module ``HPCG/2.1-goolf-1.4.10`` should have been installed.
 

By providing a set of easyconfig files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Multiple easyconfig files can be provided as well, either directly or by specifying a directory that contains easyconfig files.

For example, to build and install both HPCG and GCC with a single command, simply list the easyconfigs for both on the
``eb`` command line (note that HPCG is not being reinstalled, since a matching module is already available)::
 
  $ eb HPCG-2.1-goolf-1.4.10.eb GCC-4.8.3.eb
  [...]
  == HPCG/2.1-goolf-1.4.10 is already installed (module found), skipping
  [...]
  == building and installing GCC/4.8.3...
  [...]
  == Build succeeded for 1 out of 1
  [...]


When one or more directories are provided, EasyBuild will (recursively) traverse them
to find easyconfig files. For example:

::

  $ find set_of_easyconfigs/ -type f             
  set_of_easyconfigs/GCC-4.8.3.eb
  set_of_easyconfigs/foo.txt
  set_of_easyconfigs/tools/HPCG-2.1-goolf-1.4.10.eb

::

  $ eb set_of_easyconfigs/
  == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/easybuild-1yxCvv/easybuild-NeNmZr.log
  == HPCG/2.1-goolf-1.4.10 is already installed (module found), skipping
  == GCC/4.8.3 is already installed (module found), skipping
  == No easyconfigs left to be built.
  == Build succeeded for 0 out of 0
  == temporary log file /tmp/easybuild-1yxCvv/easybuild-NeNmZr.log has been removed.
  == temporary directory /tmp/easybuild-1yxCvv has been removed.
 
.. note:: EasyBuild will only pick up the files which end with ``.eb`` ; anything else will be ignored.
 
.. tip:: Calling EasyBuild is designed as an `idempotent` operation; 
  if a module is available that matches with an provided easyconfig file, the installation will simply be skipped.


Commonly used command line options
----------------------------------
 
Command line help, ``--help`` / ``-H``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Detailed information about the usage of the eb command is available via the ``--help``, ``-H``, ``-h`` help options.

Refer to page :ref:`basic_usage_help` for more detailed information.

.. note:: ``--help`` / ``-H`` spit out the long help info (i.e. including long option names), ``-h`` only includes short option names.
.. tip:: This is the best way to query for certain information, esp. recent features, since this is in sync with the actual EasyBuild version being used.

Report version, ``--version``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
You can query which EasyBuild version you are using with ``--version``::

  $ eb --version
  This is EasyBuild 1.15.2 (framework: 1.15.2, easyblocks: 1.15.2) on host example.local.

.. tip:: Asking EasyBuild to print own its version is a quick way to ensure that ``$PYTHONPATH``
  is set up correctly, so that the entire EasyBuild installation (framework and easyblocks) is available.

.. _list_toolchains:

List of known toolchains, ``--list-toolchains``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
For an overview of known toolchains, use ``eb --list-toolchains``.
 
Toolchains have brief mnemonic names, for example:

* ``goolf`` stands for ``GCC, OpenMPI, OpenBLAS/LAPACK, FFTW and ScaLAPACK``
* ``iimpi`` stands for ``icc/ifort, impi``
* ``cgmvolf`` stands for ``Clang/GCC, MVAPICH2, OpenBLAS/LAPACK, FFTW``

The complete table of available toolchains is available at :ref:`toolchains_table`.

List of available easyblocks, ``--list-easyblocks``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can obtain a list of available :ref:`easyblocks` via ``--list-easyblocks``.

The ``--list-easyblocks`` command line option prints the easyblocks in a hierarchical way,
showing the inheritance patterns, with the "base" easyblock class ``EasyBlock`` on top.

Software-specific easyblocks have a name that starts with ``EB_``; the ones that do not are generic easyblocks.
(cfr. :ref:`easyblocks` for the distinction between both types of easyblocks).

For example, a list of easyblocks can be obtained with::

  $ eb --list-easyblocks

Refer to page :ref:`basic_usage_easyblocks` for more information.

.. _avail_easyconfig_params:

All available easyconfig parameters, ``--avail-easyconfig-params`` / ``-a``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EasyBuild provides a significant amount of easyconfig parameters.
An overview of all available easyconfig parameters can be obtained via
``eb --avail-easyconfig-params``, or ``eb -a`` for short.

Refer to page :ref:`easyconfigs_parameters` for more information, the possible parameters are a very rich set.

Combine -a with ``--easyblock/-e`` to include parameters that are specific to a particular easyblock;
by default, the ones specific to the generic ConfigureMake easyblock are included. For example::

  $ eb -a -e EB_WRF

If you want to see the full output of running this command, look at :doc:`eb_a_e_EB_WRF`.

Enable debug logging, ``--debug`` / ``-d``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``eb --debug/-d`` to enable debug logging, to include all details of how EasyBuild performed a build in the log file::

  $ eb HPCG-2.1-goolf-1.4.10.eb -d

.. tip:: You may enable this by default via adding ``debug = True`` in your EasyBuild configuration file

.. note:: Debug log files are significantly larger than non-debug logs, so be aware.

Forced reinstallation, ``--force`` / ``-f``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``eb --force/-f`` to force the reinstallation of a given easyconfig/module.

.. warning:: Use with care, since the reinstallation of existing modules will be done without requesting confirmation first!

.. tip:: Combine ``--force`` with ``--dry-run`` to get a good view on which installations will be forced.
   (cfr. :ref:`get_an_overview`)

.. _searching_for_easyconfigs:

Searching for easyconfigs, ``--search`` / ``-S``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``--search/-S`` (long vs short output) and an easyconfig filepath pattern, for `case-insensitive` search of easyconfigs. Example::

  $ eb --search blast
  == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/easybuild-1qIvuB/easybuild-eYwxlR.log
  == Searching (case-insensitive) for 'blast' in /home/example/.local/easybuild/software/EasyBuild/1.15.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easybuild_easyconfigs-1.15.2.0-py2.7.egg/easybuild/easyconfigs

The same query with ``-S`` is far more readable, when there is a joint path that can be collapsed to a variable like ``$CFGS1``::

  == temporary directory /tmp/easybuild-tMmLMz has been removed.

The supplied pattern is used to match easyconfig **filepaths**; that aspect can be exploited to trim down
the list of easyconfigs in the search result. For example, use ``/GCC`` to search for easyconfig files for GCC::

  $ eb -S /GCC-4.9
  == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/easybuild-W40SsV/easybuild-7l96Cm.log
  == Searching (case-insensitive) for '/GCC-4.9' in /home/example/.local/easybuild/software/EasyBuild/1.15.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easybuild_easyconfigs-1.15.2.0-py2.7.egg/easybuild/easyconfigs
  CFGS1=/home/example/.local/easybuild/software/EasyBuild/1.15.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easybuild_easyconfigs-1.15.2.0-py2.7.egg/easybuild/easyconfigs/g/GCC
   * $CFGS1/GCC-4.9.0-CLooG-multilib.eb
   * $CFGS1/GCC-4.9.0-CLooG.eb
   * $CFGS1/GCC-4.9.0.eb
   * $CFGS1/GCC-4.9.1-CLooG-multilib.eb
   * $CFGS1/GCC-4.9.1-CLooG.eb
   * $CFGS1/GCC-4.9.1.eb
  == temporary log file /tmp/easybuild-W40SsV/easybuild-7l96Cm.log has been removed.
  == temporary directory /tmp/easybuild-W40SsV has been removed.

.. note:: By using a leading slash in front of a search pattern, as the last example,
  we filter out all the potential matches of easyconfigs that are built with the GCC toolchain.

.. tip:: Using ``--search`` has remarkably longer output in most cases, compared to ``-S``; the information is the same,
  however the paths towards the easyconfigs are fully expanded, taking lot of screen real estate for most people. 

.. _use_robot:

Enabling dependency resolution, ``--robot`` / ``-r`` and ``--robot-paths``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EasyBuild supports installing an entire software stack, including the required toolchain
if needed, with a single ``eb`` invocation.

To enable dependency resolution, use the ``--robot`` command line option (or ``-r`` for short)::

  $ eb mpiBLAST-1.6.0-goolf-1.4.10.eb --robot
  [...]
  == building and installing GCC/4.7.2...
  [...]
  == building and installing hwloc/1.6.2-GCC-4.7.2...
  [...]
  == building and installing OpenMPI/1.6.4-GCC-4.7.2...
  [...]
  == building and installing gompi/1.4.10...
  [...]
  == building and installing OpenBLAS/0.2.6-gompi-1.4.10-LAPACK-3.4.2...
  [...]
  == building and installing FFTW/3.3.3-gompi-1.4.10...
  [...]
  == building and installing ScaLAPACK/2.0.2-gompi-1.4.10-OpenBLAS-0.2.6-LAPACK-3.4.2...
  [...]
  == building and installing goolf/1.4.10...
  [...]
  == building and installing mpiBLAST/1.6.0-goolf-1.4.10...
  [...]
  == Build succeeded for 9 out of 9

The dependency resolution mechanism will construct a full dependency graph for the software package(s)
being installed, after which a list of dependencies is composed for which no module is available yet.
Each of the retained dependencies will then be built and installed, in the required order as indicated
by the dependency graph.

.. tip:: Using ``--robot`` is particularly useful for software packages that have an extensive list of dependencies,
  or when reinstalling software using a different compiler toolchain
  (you can use the ``--try-toolchain`` command line option in combination with ``--robot``).

.. note:: Unless dependency resolution is enabled, EasyBuid requires that modules are available for every dependency.
  If ``--robot`` is not used and one or more modules are missing, ``eb`` will exit with an error stating that a module
  for a particular dependency could not be found. For example::

    add_dependencies: no module 'GCC/4.7.2' found for dependency {...}

Searching for easyconfigs: the robot search path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each dependency that does not have a matching module installed yet, EasyBuild requires a corresponding easyconfig
file. If no such easyconfig file was specified on the ``eb`` command line, the dependency resolution mechanism will try
to locate one in the `robot search path`.

Searching for easyconfigs is done based on filename (see also :ref:`what_is_an_easyconfig`), with filenames being derived
from the dependency specification (i.e. software name/version, toolchain and version suffix). For each entry in the robot
search path, a couple of different filepaths are considered, mostly determined by the software name.

For example, when looking for an easyconfig for ``OpenMPI`` version ``1.6.4`` and version suffix ``-test`` with toolchain
``GCC/4.7.2``, the following filepaths are considered (relative to each entry in the robot search path):

* ``OpenMPI/1.6.4-GCC-4.7.2-test.eb``
* ``OpenMPI/OpenMPI-1.6.4-GCC-4.7.2-test.eb``
* ``o/OpenMPI/OpenMPI-1.6.4-GCC-4.7.2-test.eb``
* ``OpenMPI-1.6.4-GCC-4.7.2-test.eb``

.. note:: Sometimes easyconfig files are needed even when the modules for the dependencies are already available, i.e., whenever the information provided by the dependency specification (software name/version, toolchain and version suffix) is not sufficient. This is the case when using ``--dry-run`` to construct the complete dependency graph, or when the active module naming scheme requires some additional information (e.g., the ``moduleclass``).

.. note:: If EasyBuild is unable to locate required easyconfigs, an appropriate error message will be shown. For example::

    Irresolvable dependencies encountered: GCC/4.7.2

 or::

    Failed to find easyconfig file 'GCC-4.7.2.eb' when determining module name for: {...}

Default robot search path
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, EasyBuild will only include the collection of easyconfig files that is part of the EasyBuild installation
in the robot search path. More specifically, only directories listed in the `Python search path` (partially specified
by the ``$PYTHONPATH`` environment variable) that contain a subdirectory named ``easybuild/easyconfigs`` are considered
part of the robot search path (in the order they are encountered).

.. _controlling_robot_search_path:

Controlling the robot search path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To control the robot search path, you can specify a (colon-separated list of) path(s) to ``--robot`` and/or
``--robot-paths``::

Paths specified to ``--robot`` get precedence over paths specified via ``--robot-paths``.
Only ``--robot`` enables the dependency resolution mechanism; ``--robot-paths`` does not.

By combining ``--robot`` and ``--robot-paths`` on the different configuration levels (see also :ref:`configuration_types`), you have full control over the robot search path.

A constant named ``DEFAULT_ROBOT_PATHS`` is available that can be used (only) in EasyBuild configuration files to refer
to the default robot search path. For more information on using constants in EasyBuild configuration files, see
:ref:`configuration_file_templates_constants`.

.. note:: The paths specified on the configuration type with the highest order of preference `replace` any paths
  specified otherwise, i.e. values are not retained across configuration types. For more information
  see :ref:`configuration_types`.

Example use case
++++++++++++++++

For example, say we want to configure EasyBuild to behave as follows w.r.t. the robot search path:

* (always) prefer easyconfig files in the archive/repository over the ones that are included in the EasyBuild installation (i)
* consider easyconfig files located in the current directory or home directory first (in that order), before any others (ii)

Matching setup:

* satisfy (i) using ``robot-paths`` in one of the active EasyBuild configuration files (see also
  :ref:`list_of_configuration_files`)::

    robot-paths = %(repositorypath)s:%(DEFAULT_ROBOT_PATHS)s

* satisfy (ii) via ``--robot`` on the ``eb`` command line::

    eb mpiBLAST-1.6.0-goolf-1.4.10.eb --robot $PWD:$HOME


.. _get_an_overview:

Get an overview of planned installations ``--dry-run`` / ``-D``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can do a "dry-run" overview by supplying ``-D/--dry-run`` (typically combined with ``--robot``, in the form of ``-Dr``)::

  $ eb mpiBLAST-1.6.0-goolf-1.4.10.eb -Dr

Note how the different status symbols denote distinct handling states by EasyBuild:

* ``[ ]`` The build is not available, EasyBuild will deliver it
* ``[x]`` The build is available, EasyBuild will skip building this module
* ``[F]`` The build is available, however EasyBuild has been asked to force a rebuild and will do so


.. _tweaking_easyconfigs_using_try:

Tweaking existing easyconfig files, using ``--try-*``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Making minor changes to existing easyconfig files can be done straight from the ``eb`` command line.
This way, having to manually copying and editing easyconfig files can be avoided.

Tweaking existing easyconfig files can be done using the **--try-*** command line options.
For each of the software build options that can be used as an alternative to specifying easyconfig file names,
a matching ``--try-X`` command line options is available:

* ``--try-toolchain`` to try using the toolchain with the given name and version

  * format: ``--try-toolchain=<name>,<version>``
  * ``--try-toolchain-name`` to try using the latest toolchain version of a toolchain
  * ``--try-toolchain-version`` to try using a different toolchain version

* ``--try-software-version`` to try building a different software version
* ``--try-amend`` to try tweaking a different easyconfig parameter

  * format: ``--try-amend=<param>=<value>``
  * only supports string and list-of-strings value types

For example, to build and install WRF and its dependencies with a different toolchain version::

    $ eb WRF-3.5.1-goolf-1.4.10-dmpar.eb --try-toolchain-version=1.5.14 -Dr

.. note:: The ``--try-*`` command line options behave as expected when combined with ``--robot``. For example: a modified toolchain specified via ``--try-toolchain`` only trickles down until the toolchain level (not deeper). This makes for a particularly powerful combo for rebuilding entire software stacks using a different toolchain.

.. note:: Modifying the software version does **note** trickle down the entire software stack, even when combined with ``--robot``, since a software version is tied to a particular software package.
