Writing easyconfig files: the basics
====================================

This page explains all the basic information about how to write easyconfig files.

For software builds that follow established build patterns, an easyconfig is all that you need to create in order to
build and install the software and the corresponding module file.

Luckily, the majority of software delivery mechanisms are being designed around
either autotools or CMake or, perhaps, some simple file extraction/copy pattern.
In that case, a *generic easyblock* can be leveraged; see :ref:`generic_easyblocks`.

Yet, in case the software build calls for more elaborate steps
(scientific software never fails to surprise us in this regard),
a software-specific easyblock may be required; see :ref:`implementing_easyblocks`.

.. _what_is_an_easyconfig:

What is an easyconfig (file)?
-----------------------------

An easyconfig file serves as a `build specification` for EasyBuild.

It consists of a plain text file (in Python syntax) with mostly `key-value` assignment to define **easyconfig parameters**.

Easyconfigs typically follow a (fixed) strict naming scheme, i.e.  ``<name>-<version>[-<toolchain>][<versionsuffix>].eb``.

The ``-<toolchain>`` label (which includes the toolchain name and version) is omitted when a :ref:`system_toolchain` is used.
The ``<versionsuffix>`` label is omitted when the version suffix is empty.

.. note:: the filename of an easyconfig is only important w.r.t. dependency resolution (``--robot``), see :ref:`use_robot`.

Example:

.. code:: python

  # easyconfig file for GCC v4.8.3
  name = 'GCC'
  version = '4.8.3'
  ...

.. tip:: Comments can be included in easyconfig files using the hash (``#``) character (just like in Python code).

Available easyconfig parameters
-------------------------------

About 50 different (generic) easyconfig parameters are supported currently.
An overview of all available easyconfig parameters is available via the ``-a`` command line option.

By default, the parameters specific to generic (default) easyblock ``ConfigureMake`` are included;
using ``--easyblock``/``-e`` parameters that are specific to a particular easyblock can be consulted.

See :ref:`easyconfig_params` for more details.

Example::

 $ eb -a -e Binary
 Available easyconfig parameters (* indicates specific for the Binary EasyBlock)
 MANDATORY
 ---------
 [..]
 name:           Name of software (default: None)
 [...]
 EASYBLOCK-SPECIFIC
 ------------------
 install_cmd(*):     Install command to be used. (default: None)
 [...]

Mandatory easyconfig parameters
-------------------------------

A handful of easyconfig parameters are `mandatory`:

* **name, version**: specify what software (version) to build
* **homepage, description**: metadata (used for module help)
* **toolchain**: specifies name and version of compiler toolchain to use

  * format: dictionary with name/version keys, e.g., ``{'name': 'foo', 'version': '1.2.3'}``
  * a list of supported toolchains can be found :ref:`here <vsd_list_toolchains>`

Remarks:

* some others are planned to be required in the future

  * `docurls, software license, software license urls`

Example:

.. code:: python

  name = 'HPL'
  version = '2.0'

  homepage = 'http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/'
  description = "High Performance Computing Linpack Benchmark"

  toolchain = {'name': 'goolf', 'version': '1.4.10'}
  [...]

Common easyconfig parameters
----------------------------

This section includes an overview of some commonly used (optional) easyconfig parameters.

.. _common_easyconfig_param_sources:

Source files, patches and checksums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **sources**: list of source files (filenames only)
* **source urls**: list of URLs where sources can be downloaded
* **patches**: list of patch files to be applied (``.patch`` extension)
* **checksums**: list of checksums for source and patch files

Remarks:

* sources are downloaded (best effort), unless already available
* proxy settings are taken into account, since the `urllib2 Python package <https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html>`_
  is used for downloading (since EasyBuild v2.0)
* patches need to be EasyBuild-compatible

  * unified diff format (``diff -ruN``)
  * patched locations relative to unpacked sources

* see :ref:`common_easyconfig_param_sources_patches` for more information on ``patches``
* see :ref:`common_easyconfig_param_sources_checksums` for more information on ``checksums``
* ``sources`` is usually specified as a list of strings representing filenames for source files,
  but other formats are supported too, see :ref:`common_easyconfig_param_sources_alt`

Example:

.. code:: python

  name = 'HPL'
  version = '2.2'

  [...]

  source_urls = ['http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl']
  sources = ['hpl-%(version)s.tar.gz']

  # fix Make dependencies, so parallel build also works
  patches = ['HPL_parallel-make.patch']

  checksums = ['ac7534163a09e21a5fa763e4e16dfc119bc84043f6e6a807aba666518f8df440']

  [...]

.. note:: Rather than hardcoding the version (and name) in the list of sources,
  a string template `%(version)s` can be used, see also :ref:`easyconfig_param_templates`.

.. _common_easyconfig_param_sources_patches:

Patches
^^^^^^^

Patches can be provided via the ``patches`` easyconfig parameter (list). A patch can be defined as:

* a ``string``,
* a ``tuple`` of 2 elements, or
* a ``dict``

The most straight-forward use-case is ``string``, which contains the name of the patch file
(and must have ``.patch`` extension).

A ``tuple`` adds the possibility to specify where patch should be applied.
This is mostly needed if a patch file adds new files or it is generally not possible to determine
the starting directory.  
The first element is the patch file and the second is
either the patch level (as an integer) which is used in the patch command (``patch -p<n>``)
or a directory relative to the unpacked source dir.

.. note:: ``tuple`` also has a special use case if the patch file has any other extension than ``.patch``.
          In this case, the first tuple argument is a file which should be copied to the unpacked source
          dir and the second tuple argument is the target path, where the files should be copied to
          (relative to the unpacked source dir). See below for an example of this use case.

A ``dict`` adds the ability to pass the ``patch`` command additional arguments. For example, the
``--binary`` flag is needed to patch files with CRLF endings.
The ``dict`` has a required ``filename`` key, with ``level`` and ``opts`` being optional ones.

.. note:: Specifying only ``filename`` in ``dict`` is the same as using a plain ``string`` definition.
          Specifying ``filename`` and ``level`` is same as using a ``tuple`` definition.

Example:

.. code:: python

    patches = [
      # a simple patch file
      'name-versions-fix.patch',

      # when creating only new files by patch file, you need to specify the level:
      ('name-versions-fix.patch', 1),

      # apply the patch in a (sub-)subdirectory inside the source tree
      ('name-versions-fix.patch', 'src/subfolder'),

      # copy file to target_path folder
      ('Makefile', 'target_path'),

      # specify patch file and optionally level and opts for patch command
      {'filename': 'name-versions-fix.patch', 'level': 1, 'opts': '-l'}
    ]

.. _common_easyconfig_param_sources_checksums:

Checksums
^^^^^^^^^

Checksums for source files and patches can be provided via the ``checksums`` easyconfig parameter.

EasyBuild does not enforce checksums to be available for all source files and patches.
Provided checksums will be 'consumed' first for the specified sources (in order), and subsequently also for patches.

Nevertheless, providing checksums for *all* source files and patches is highly recommended.

If checksums are provided, the checksum of the corresponding source files and patches is verified to match.


The ``checksums`` easyconfig parameter is a list usually containing strings.

Until EasyBuild v3.3.0, only MD5 checksums could be provided through a list of strings.
Since EasyBuild v3.3.0, the checksum type is determined by looking at the length of the string:

* 32-character strings are considered to be MD5 checksums (``md5``)
* 64-character strings are considered to be SHA256 checksums (``sha256``)
* (other lengths will result in an error message)

The intention is to move towards making ``sha256`` the recommended and default checksum type.

Other checksum types are also supported: ``adler32``, ``crc32``, ``sha1``, ``sha512``, ``size`` (filesize in bytes).
To provide checksum values of a specific type, elements of the ``checksums`` list can also be 2-element tuples
of the form ``('<checksum type>', '<checksum value>')``. For example:

.. code:: python

  checksums = [('sha512', 'f962008105639f58e9a4455c8057933ab0a5e2f43db8340ae1e1afe6dc2d24105bfca3b2e1f79cb242495ca4eb363c9820d8cea6084df9d62c4c3e5211d99266')]

It is also possible to specify alternative checksums using a tuple of checksum elements where any match is sufficient (logical OR).
This is helpful when the release was updated but can still be used (e.g. only doc changes).

.. code:: python

  checksums = [('mainchecksum', 'alternativechecksum')]  # Placeholders used

The opposite is also possible:
A list instead of a tuple denotes that **all** checksums must match (logical AND).
In both cases each element can also be a type-value-tuple:

.. code:: python

  checksums = [[('size', 42), 'sha256checksum')]  # Placeholder used

Finally a checksum can be specified as a dictionary mapping filenames to checksums.
This is useful when the source file is specified using e.g. the `%(arch)s` template.
Again elements (values) can be strings or type-value-tuples.
For example:

.. code:: python

  checksums = [{
    'src_x86_64.tgz': 'f962008105639f58e9a4455c8057933ab0a5e2f43db8340ae1e1afe6dc2d2410',
    'src_aarch64.tgz': ('size', 42),
  }]

Of course this can be combined with the logical AND/OR semantics using lists or tuples:

.. code:: python

  checksums = [{
    'src_x86_64.tgz': ('oldchecksum', 'newchecksum'),
    'src_aarch64.tgz': [('size', 42), 'checksumthatmustmatchtoo'],
  }]

When the checksum cannot be specified for a file (e.g. when using a git clone instead of an archive) a value of `None` can be used to skip the checksum check.
This is possible in the list of checksums as well as as a value in a dictionary, e.g.:

.. code:: python

  checksums = [{
    None, # No checksum for first source file
    'checksumfor2ndfile',
    {
      'third_file_x86_64.tgz': 'checksum',
      'third_file_aarch64.tgz': None,
    },
  ]

The difference between having an entry in the dict with the value of `None` and not having an entry
only matters when using the `--enforce_checksums` option which will raise an error in the latter case.

.. _inject_checksums:

Adding or replacing checksums using ``--inject-checksums``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using the ``--inject-checksums`` command line option, you can let EasyBuild add or update checksums
in one or more easyconfig files (which is significantly more convenient than doing it manually).

With ``--inject-checksums``, checksums are injected for all sources and patches (if any),
as well as for all sources & patches of every extension listed in ``exts_list`` (if any, see :ref:`module_extensions`).

If the sources (& patches) are not available yet, EasyBuild will try to download them first; i.e.,
the ``fetch`` step is run prior to computing & injecting the checksums.

A backup is created of every easyconfig file that is touched by ``--inject-checksums``,
to avoid accidental loss of information. Backups are given an additional extension of the
form ``.bak_<year><month><day><hour><min><sec>``.

.. note::

    To clean up backup easyconfig files, you can use this one-liner::

        find . -name '*.eb.bak_*' | xargs rm -v

    The ``-v`` option makes ``rm`` print the path of files that are being removed.

    **Do use this with care; just run** ``find . -name '*.eb.bak_*'`` **first in case of doubt!**

Multilple easyconfigs can be specified when using ``--inject-checksums``, they will be processed in sequence.
In addition, you can also combine ``--inject-checksums`` with ``--robot``, see :ref:`inject_checksums_robot_synergy`.

.. _inject_checksums_adding:

Adding checksums when none are specified yet
********************************************

If the easyconfig file does not specify any checksums yet, they are simply injected after the
``sources`` (or ``patches``, if present) specification when ``--inject-checksums`` is used.

For example::

    $ eb bzip2-1.0.6.eb --inject-checksums
    == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-Vm6w3e/easybuild-cAVQl6.log
    == injecting sha256 checksums in /example/bzip2-1.0.6.eb
    == fetching sources & patches for bzip2-1.0.6.eb...
    == backup of easyconfig file saved to /example/bzip2-1.0.6.eb.bak_20170824200906...
    == injecting sha256 checksums for sources & patches in bzip2-1.0.6.eb...
    == * bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz: a2848f34fcd5d6cf47def00461fcb528a0484d8edef8208d6d2e2909dc61d9cd
    == Temporary log file(s) /tmp/eb-Vm6w3e/easybuild-cAVQl6.log* have been removed.
    == Temporary directory /tmp/eb-Vm6w3e has been removed.

The backup easyconfig file can be used to double-check the difference between the original easyconfig file
and the one produced by ``--inject-checksums``::

    $ diff -u /example/bzip2-1.0.6.eb.bak_20170824200906 /example/bzip2-1.0.6.eb
    diff --git a//example/bzip2-1.0.6.eb.bak_20170824200906 b/example/bzip2-1.0.6.eb

     buildopts = "CC=gcc CFLAGS='-Wall -Winline -O3 -fPIC -g $(BIGFILES)'"

.. note:: Along with injecting checksums, EasyBuild will also reorder the ``source_urls``, ``sources``
          and ``patches`` specifications, in that order and if they are present, and include the ``checksums``
          specification afterwards. This is done to facilitate working towards a uniform style in easyconfig files,
          which also applies to the order of specified easyconfig parameters.

.. _inject_checksums_replacing:

Replacing existing checksums
****************************

When one or more checksums are already specified, EasyBuild requires the use of ``--force`` together
with ``--inject-checksums`` to replace those checksums. A clear warning will be printed to notify
that existing checksums will be replaced.

For example::

    $ eb bzip2-1.0.6.eb --inject-checksums
    == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-WhSwVH/easybuild-HCODnl.log
    == injecting sha256 checksums in /example/bzip2-1.0.6.eb
    == fetching sources & patches for bzip2-1.0.6.eb...
    ERROR: Found existing checksums, use --force to overwrite them

.. code:: bash

    $ eb bzip2-1.0.6.eb --inject-checksums --force
    == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-dS2QLa/easybuild-JGxOzC.log
    == injecting sha256 checksums in /example/bzip2-1.0.6.eb
    == fetching sources & patches for bzip2-1.0.6.eb...

    WARNING: Found existing checksums in bzip2-1.0.6.eb, overwriting them (due to use of --force)...

    == backup of easyconfig file saved to /example/bzip2-1.0.6.eb.bak_20170824203850...
    == injecting sha256 checksums for sources & patches in bzip2-1.0.6.eb...
    ...

.. note::
    Any existing checksums are *blindly* replaced when ``--inject-checksums --force`` is used:
    the existing checksums are *not verified* to be correct as during normal use of EasyBuild
    (since that would kind of defeat the purpose of ``--inject-checksums``).

    In addition, it also doesn't matter whether or not checksums are available for all sources & patches:
    with ``--inject-checksums``, checksums will be added for *all* sources and patches,
    including for extensions listed in ``exts_list`` (if any).

.. _inject_checksums_robot_synergy:

Synergy between ``--inject-checksums`` and ``--robot``
******************************************************

When ``--inject-checksums`` is combined with ``--robot``, checksums are injected for *each* easyconfig file
in the dependency graph for which no module is available yet.

For example, to inject checksums in *every* easyconfig file required to build HPL 2.2 with the ``foss/2017a`` toolchain::

    $ MODULEPATH= eb HPL-2.2-foss-2017a.eb --installpath /tmp/$USER/sandbox --inject-checksums --robot
    == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/eb-8HpJc3/easybuild-H35khM.log
    == resolving dependencies ...
    ...
    == injecting sha256 checksums in /example/GCCcore-6.3.0.eb
    ...
    == injecting sha256 checksums in /example/OpenMPI-2.0.2-GCC-6.3.0-2.27.eb
    ...
    == injecting sha256 checksums in /example/FFTW-3.3.6-gompi-2017a.eb
    ...
    == injecting sha256 checksums in /example/HPL-2.2-foss-2017a.eb
    ...

.. note:: We are clearing ``$MODULEPATH`` and specifying a custom (empty) location to ``--installpath`` to
          avoid that EasyBuild skips any easyconfig because a corresponding module is already available.

.. _inject_checksums_type:

Type of checksum to inject
**************************

By default, ``--inject-checksums`` will compute & inject ``SHA256`` checksums, but a different checksum type
can be specified as an argument (e.g., ``--inject-checksums md5``).

.. note:: Because of the optional argument that can be passed to ``--inject-checksums``,
          you should not specify an easyconfig file name directly after the ``--inject-checksums``,
          since it will be assumed to specify a checksum type, which will result in an error message like::

            $ eb --inject-checksums bzip2-1.0.6.eb
            Usage: eb [options] easyconfig [...]

            eb: error: option --inject-checksums: invalid choice: 'bzip2-1.0.6.eb' (choose from 'adler32', 'crc32', 'md5', 'sha1', 'sha256', 'sha512', 'size')


.. _common_easyconfig_param_sources_alt:

Alternative formats for ``sources``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, it can be required to provide additional information next to the name of a source file,
e.g., a custom extraction command (because the one derived from the file extension is not correct),
or an altername filename that should be used to download the source file.

This can be specified using a Python dictionary value in the ``sources`` easyconfig parameter.

Since EasyBuild v3.3.0, three keys are supported:

* ``filename`` (*mandatory*): filename of source file
* ``download_filename``: filename that should be used when downloading this source file; the downloaded file will be
  saved using the ``filename`` value
* ``extract_cmd``: custom extraction command for this source file
* ``source_urls``: source URLs to consider for downloading this source file
* ``git_config``: see :ref:`common_easyconfig_param_sources_git_config`

For example:

.. code:: python

  sources = [{
      'source_urls': ['https://example.com'],
      'filename': 'example-%(version)s.gz',
      'download_filename': 'example.gz',  # provided source tarball is not versioned...
      'extract_cmd': "tar xfvz %s",  # source file is actually a gzipped tarball (filename should be .tar.gz)
  }]

.. note:: Custom extraction commands can also be specified as a 2-element tuple, but this format has been deprecated
          in favor of the Python dictionary format described above; see also :ref:`depr_sources_2_element_tuple`.

Using ``download_instructions`` for user-side part of installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, getting some of the files required for an installation cannot be automated. Reasons for this include:

* there is a manual stage to combine multiple downloaded files into the required installation file
* the file requires a login to download

You can use the ``download_instructions`` parameter to specify steps for the user to do.
This parameter takes string value and prints it whenever build fails because any file needed was not found.
If ``download_instructions`` is not specified, Easybuild prints the default message stating the paths that were tested.

.. code:: python

    download_instructions = """
      Step 1: Go to example.com and download example.jar.
      Step 2: Install example.jar (ensure Java is installed).
      Step 3: Go to the installation directory and create Tarball of its contents (tar -czvf example.tar.gz *).
      Step 4: Move created Tarball into the same directory, where your easyconfig is located and run build again.
    """

.. _common_easyconfig_param_sources_git_config:

Downloading from a Git repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since EasyBuild v3.7.0, support for downloading directly from a Git repository is available.

When ``git_config`` is provided for a particular source file (see :ref:`common_easyconfig_param_sources_alt`),
EasyBuild will create a source tarball after downloading the specified Git repository.

The value for ``git_config`` is a Python dictionary, where the following keys are *mandatory*:

* ``url``: the URL where the Git repository is located
* ``repo_name``: the name of the Git repository

The value for ``filename`` in the source specification *must* end in ``.tar.gz`` (because a gzipped tarball
will be created from the cloned repository).

In addition, either of the following keys *must* also be defined:

* ``tag``: the specific tag to download
* ``commit``: the specific commit ID to download

If a recursive checkout should be made of the repository, the ``recursive`` key can be set to ``True``.

To also retain the ``.git`` directory (which holds the Git metadata for the repository),
you can set the ``keep_git_dir`` to ``True`` (supported since EasyBuild v4.2.0).

A different name for the top-level directory can be specified via ``clone_into``;
by default the name of the repository is used.

Examples:

  * creating a source tarball named ``example-main.tar.gz`` of the ``main`` branch of a (fictional)
    ``test`` repository from ``https://agitserver.org/example``, and use ``example-test`` as top-level directory name:

    .. code::

      sources = [{
          'filename': 'example-main.tar.gz',
          'git_config': {
              'url': 'https://agitserver.org/example',
              'repo_name': 'test',
              'tag': 'main',
              'clone_into': 'example-test',
          },
      }]

  * creating a source tarball named ``example-20180920.tar.gz`` of the recursive checkout of commit ``abcdef12``
    of the ``test`` repository from ``https://agitserver.org/example``:

    .. code::

      sources = [{
          'filename': 'example-20180920.tar.gz',
          'git_config': {
              'url': 'https://agitserver.org/example',
              'repo_name': 'test',
              'commit': 'abcdef12',
              'recursive': True,
              'keep_git_dir': True,
          },
      }]


.. note:: Because the source tarball is created locally (by running ``tar cfvz`` on the directory containing
          the cloned repository), the (SHA256) checksum is not guaranteed to be the same across different systems.

          Whenever you have the option to download a source tarball (or equivalent) directly (for example from GitHub,
          which also allows downloading a tarball of a specific commit), we strongly recommend you to do so,
          ``git_config`` is intended for other Git repos.


.. _dependency_specs:

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **dependencies**: build/runtime dependencies
* **builddependencies**: build-only dependencies (not in module)
* **hiddendependencies**: dependencies via hidden modules (see also :ref:`hide_deps`)
* **osdependencies**: system dependencies (package names)

Remarks:

* modules must exist for all (non-system) dependencies
* (non-system) dependencies can be resolved via ``--robot``
* format: ``(<name>, <version>[, <versionsuffix>[, <toolchain>]])``

Example:

.. code:: python

  name = 'GTI'
  ...
  toolchain = {'name': 'goolf', 'version': '1.5.14'}
  dependencies = [('PnMPI', '1.2.0')]
  builddependencies = [('CMake', '2.8.12', '', ('GCC', '4.8.2'))]

For each of the specified (build) dependencies, the corresponding module will be loaded in the build environment
defined by EasyBuild. For the *runtime* dependencies, ``module load`` statements will be included in the generated
module file.

.. note:: By default, EasyBuild will try to resolve dependencies using the same toolchain as specified for the
  software being installed. As of v3.0, if no easyconfig exists to resolve a dependency using the default
  toolchain EasyBuild will search for the dependency using a compatible subtoolchain.

  A different toolchain can be specified on a per-dependency level (cfr. the ``CMake`` build dependency in the
  example above).

  Alternatively, you can instruct EasyBuild to use the most minimal (sub)toolchain when resolving dependencies,
  see :ref:`minimal_toolchains`.

Loading of modules for dependencies with a ``system`` toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a :ref:`system_toolchain` is used, the modules for each of the (build) dependencies are *always*
loaded, regardless of the toolchain version (as opposed the behaviour with the ``dummy`` toolchain in EasyBuild
versions prior to v4.0, see :ref:`system_toolchain_motivation_deprecating_dummy`).

Specifying dependencies using ``system`` toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make EasyBuild resolve a dependency using the ``system`` toolchain, simply use the ``SYSTEM`` template constant as
the 4th value in the tuple representing the dependency specification.

For example, to specify PnMPI version 1.2.0 built with the ``system`` toolchain as a (runtime) dependency::

  dependencies = [('PnMPI', '1.2.0', '', SYSTEM)]


Using external modules as dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since EasyBuild v2.1, specifying modules that are not provided via EasyBuild as dependencies is also supported.
See :ref:`using_external_modules` for more information.


Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~

Besides dependencies, which are found outside the software being built but are part of the site's EasyBuild installation,
it is also possible to incorporate extensions to the software within the build.  This is done via the ``exts_list`` array.

Each entry in ``exts_list`` is a three-component tuple, with the name and
version number, and a dictionary of configuration options for the entry:

.. code:: python

  exts_list = [
      ('name', 'version', { 'option':'value', 'option':'value' })
  ]

The latter may contain essentially any of the full easyconfig parameters, including ``buildopts``, ``installopts``, etc.
Among those options, the following exceptions and special cases should be noted:

* **nosource**: If set ``True``, no download will be done
* **source_tmpl**: Template string for the file to be downloaded
  * default is ``'%(name)s-%(version)s.tar.gz'``
  * ``%(name)s`` and ``%(version)s`` come from the ``exts_list`` entry (above)
* **sources**: Dictionary specifying details of where to download the extension
  * equivalent to a single entry from the easyconfig ``sources`` list
  * preferred to use of ``source_tmpl``
* **start_dir**: If not set, will be derived; the easyconfig value will not be used

.. code:: python

  exts_list = [
      ('llvmlite', '0.26.0', {
          'source_urls': ['https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/l/llvmlite/'],
          'patches': ['llvmlite-0.26.0_fix-ffi-Makefile.patch'],
          'checksums': [
              '13e84fe6ebb0667233074b429fd44955f309dead3161ec89d9169145dbad2ebf',    # llvmlite-0.26.0.tar.gz
              '40e6fe6de48709b45daebf8082f65ac26f73a4afdf58fc1e8099b97c575fecae',    # llvmlite-0.26.0_fix-ffi-Makefile.patch
          ],
      }),
      ('singledispatch', '3.4.0.3', {
          'source_urls': ['https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/singledispatch/'],
          'checksums': ['5b06af87df13818d14f08a028e42f566640aef80805c3b50c5056b086e3c2b9c'],
      }),
      (name, version, {
          'source_urls': ['https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/n/numba/'],
          'checksums': ['c62121b2d384d8b4d244ef26c1cf8bb5cb819278a80b893bf41918ad6d391258'],
      }),
  ]

That third instance uses the ``name`` and ``version`` variables defined in the easyconfig file.  Since EasyBuild
v4.2.2, a single-entry ``sources`` dictionary (see :ref:`_common_easyconfig_param_sources_alt`) may be included in an
``exts_list`` entry.  For example, to download Git sources from a private repository and convert them to a tar-ball for
installation:

.. code:: python

  exts_defaultclass = 'PythonPackage'
  exts_list = [
      ('pyCAP', '0.1', {
          'sources': {
              'filename': '%(name)s-%(version)s.tar.gz',
              'git_config': {
                  'url': 'ssh://nero.stanford.edu/data/git/Analysis',
                  'repo_name': 'pyCAP',
                  'tag': '%(version)s',
              }
          }
      }),
  ]

Here, the template strings ``%(name)s`` and ``%(version)s`` will be substituted from the
``exts_list`` entry elements ("pyCAP" and "0.1", respectively), not from the easyconfig values.


.. _configure_build_install_command_options:

Configure/build/install command options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **configopts**: options for configure command
* **preconfigopts**: options used as prefix for configure command

In analogy to `configure`, also `build` and `install` commands are tuneable:

* **buildopts, prebuildopts**: options for build command
* **installopts, preinstallopts**: options for install command

Example:

.. code:: python

    easyblock = 'ConfigureMake'
    ...
    # configure with: ./autogen.sh && ./configure CC="$CC" CFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
    preconfigopts = "./autogen.sh && "
    buildopts = 'CC="$CC" CFLAGS="$CFLAGS"'
    # install with: make install PREFIX=<installation prefix>
    installopts = 'PREFIX=%(installdir)s'

.. note:: For more details w.r.t. use of string templates like ``%(installdir)s``, see :ref:`easyconfig_param_templates`.


.. _configure_build_install_command_options_iterate:

List of configure/build/install options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, the *configure-build-install* cycle must be executed multiple times during a single installation,
using different options for one or more steps.

EasyBuild supports specifying a *list* of strings, each of which specifying a particular set of options to use.

For example, to perform the installation procedure with three different sets of configuration options:

.. code:: python

    configopts = [
        "--common-opt --one --one-more",
        "--common-opt --two",
        "--common-opt --three",
    ]

This way, EasyBuild will perform the *configure-build-install* cycle **three** times:

* configure using ``--common-opt --one --one-more``, build and install
* configure using ``--common-opt --two``, build and install on top of the existing installation
* configure using ``--common-opt --three``, build and install once more on top of what is installed already

During this process, the environment is reset and the build directory is cleaned up after each cycle,
while the installation directory is left untouched (in order to not destroy the result of earlier cycles).

If several ``(pre){config|build|install}opts`` parameters are defined as being a list of strings, the number of
items in the lists must be the same. Any of these parameters defined as a single string value are just reused
for each of the cycles performed. For example:

.. code:: python

    easyblock = 'ConfigureMake'
    configopts = ['--one', '--two', '--three']
    buildopts = 'lib'
    preinstallopts = ['TYPE=one', 'TYPE=two', 'TYPE=three']

would result in:

* ``./configure --prefix=... --one; make lib; TYPE=one make install``
* ``./configure --prefix=... --two; make lib; TYPE=two make install``
* ``./configure --prefix=... --three; make lib; TYPE=three make install``


An example use case of this is building FFTW with different precisions, see the
`FFTW easyconfig files <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/main/easybuild/easyconfigs/f/FFTW>`_.

Sanity check
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom paths and commands to be used in the sanity check step can be specified using the respective parameters.
These are used to make sure that an installation didn't (partly) fail unnoticed.

* **sanity_check_paths**: files/directories that must get installed
* **sanity_check_commands**: (simple) commands that must work when the installed module is loaded

Remarks:

* format: Python dictionary with (`only`) ``files``/``dirs`` keys
* values must be lists of (tuples of) strings, one of both **must** be non-empty

  * paths are `relative` to installation directory
  * for a path specified as a tuple, only one of the specified paths must be available

* default values:

  * paths: non-empty ``bin`` and ``lib`` or ``lib64`` directories
  * commands: none

Example:

.. code:: python

  sanity_check_paths = {
      'files': ["bin/xhpl"],
      'dirs': [],
  }

.. _writing_easyconfigs_easyblock_spec:

Easyblock specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make EasyBuild use a specific (usually generic) easyblock the **easyblock** parameter can be used.

By default, EasyBuild will assume that the easyblock to use can be derived from the software name.
For example: for ``GCC``, EasyBuild will look for an easyblock class named ``EB_GCC`` in the Python module
``easybuild.easyblocks.gcc``.

A list of available easyblocks is available via ``--list-easyblocks`` (see also :ref:`list_easyblocks`);
generic easyblocks are the ones for which the name does *not* start with ``EB_``.

Example:

.. code:: python

    easyblock = 'CMakeMake'
    name = 'GTI'
    version = '1.2.0'
    ...

.. tip::
  It is highly recommended to use existing (generic) easyblocks, where applicable.
  This avoids the need for creating (and maintaining) new easyblocks.
  Typically, generic easyblocks support several custom easyconfig parameters which allow to steer
  their behavior (see also :ref:`avail_easyconfig_params`).

Example:

.. code:: python

  easyblock = 'Binary'
  [...]
  install_cmd = "./install.bin"
  [...]


Module class
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The category to which the software belongs to can be specified using the **moduleclass** easyconfig parameter.
By default, the ``base`` module class is used (which should be replaced with a more appropriate category).

EasyBuild enforces that only known module classes can be specified (to avoid misclassification due to typos).

The default list of module classes is available via ``--show-default-moduleclasses``;
additional module classes can be defined via the ``--moduleclasses`` configure option.

Example:

.. code:: python

    name = 'GCC'
    [...]
    moduleclass = 'compiler'

.. note:: By default, EasyBuild will create a symlink to the generated module file in a module class-specific path.
  This behavior is configurable through the module naming scheme being used.

.. tip:: The module class may play a significant role in other aspects. For example, the alternative (hierarchical)
  module naming scheme ``HierarchicalMNS`` heavily relies on the ``moduleclass`` parameter for discriminating compilers
  and MPI libraries.

Tweaking existing easyconfig files
----------------------------------

The ability to modify easyconfig files on the fly with EasyBuild,
provides a very powerful and flexible feature to describe builds,
without having to manually create all the input files.

Tweaking existing easyconfigs can be done using the ``--try-*`` command lines options.
See :ref:`tweaking_easyconfigs_using_try` for more details.

Example:

* GCC version update::

   eb GCC-4.9.0.eb --try-software-version=4.9.1

* install WRF + its dozen dependencies with a different toolchain (!)::

   eb WRF-3.5.1-ictce-5.3.0-dmpar.eb --try-toolchain=intel,2014b -r

.. _easyconfig_param_templates:

Dynamic values for easyconfig parameters
----------------------------------------

String templates are completed using the value of particular easyconfig parameters, typically ``name`` and/or ``version``.
These help to avoid hardcoding values in multiple locations.

A list of available string templates can be obtained using ``--avail-easyconfig-templates``.

Additionally, constants that can be used in easyconfig files are available via ``--avail-easyconfig-constants``.

Example:

.. code:: python

  name = 'GCC'
  version = '4.8.3'
  ...
  source_urls = [
      # http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gcc/gcc-4.8.3
      'http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/%(namelower)s/%(namelower)s-%(version)s',
  ]
  sources = [SOURCELOWER_TAR_GZ]  # gcc-4.8.3.tar.gz
  ...

.. note:: Proper use of string templates is important, in particular to avoid hardcoding the software version
  in multiple locations of an easyconfig file; this is critical to make ``--try-software-version`` behave
  as expected (see also :ref:`tweaking_easyconfigs_using_try`).
