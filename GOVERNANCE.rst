Goverance Document
====================

This document describes the governance model of the Easybuild Project.

Overview
----------

The Easybuild Project  is an open source software and released under GNU General Public License v2.0 and developed openly 
and hosted in public GitHub repositories under the `easybuilders <https://github.com/easybuilders>`_ organization. 

The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called Contributors. Contributors are individuals who have 
contributed code, documentation, designs or other work to one or more Project repositories. Anyone can be a Contributor. 
Contributors can be affiliated with any legal entity or none. Contributors participate in the project by submitting, 
reviewing and discussing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues and participating in open and public Project discussions on 
GitHub, Slack, and mailing lists. The foundation of Project participation is openness and transparency.

BFDL
----

The Project will have a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life), who is currently Kenneth Hoste. 
As Dictator, the BDFL has the authority to make all final decisions for The Project. As Benevolent, 
the BDFL, in practice chooses to defer that authority to the consensus of the community discussion channels
